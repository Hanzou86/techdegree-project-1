        <h2>Finished First Project</h2>
        <p>Aug 9 2021</p>
        <p>The past year has been a bit of a ride for me when it comes to career
        searching. I knew I wanted to be involved in programming in some sense, but
        I didn't realize just how vast the field was. Even web development is very broad,
        with many sub disciplines within it.
        </p>
        <p>The first jumping off point for me was trying out FreeCode Camp. It is a
        great resource and the fact that its free is astonishing. However I found it difficult 
        to progress due to the lack of certain features. This was also the case with 
        Codecademy, another popular online platform. There wasn't enough video tutorials
        or quizes to keep things engaging for me.
        </p>
        <p>Several months later I was starting to feel worn out due to my lack of progress.
        I was aware of a platform called Treehouse at that point and decided to check it out.
        Several youtube reviews had positive things to say about Treehouse, including
        that it uses a lot of video tutorials. This was a huge draw for me as I am a visual
        learner. So I decided to give Treehouse a try, specifically their front end Techdegree
        program which is designed for career placement.
        </p>
        <p>I've been 3 weeks into the Treehouse techdegree program and it has been a 
        great experience. Because the program is project based all the theory has a practical
        goal. Several types of learning material are used including lectures, quizes, and
        exercises. By the time I got to the project segment of the unit I felt prepared to
        complete it. Material is provided that lays out all expectations so that students 
        are successful</p>
        <p>The project itself is not too difficult. It is a profile page that can be used
        as a resume for future job applications. Everything is provided to complete the project
        so its not from scratch. The goal is to modify the code with enough personal touches to make
        it your own. The project is meant to test an understanding of basic html and css, such
        as using links and changing color.</p>
        <p>I really like how Treehouse focuses on building projects. Everything that's learned has
        an internal purpose to it. The variety of learning tools has helped me 
        tremendouly with my progress. Any time I've had a question the Slack community has
        been very helpful. </p>
        <p>All in all my experience with the program has been very good. It is on
          the pricier side compared to other online platforms but it is meant to be a bootcamp quality
          program for career preparation. Depending on your learning style other platforms may be fine.
          I recommend Treehouse however if you're serious about getting a junior developer position. Hopefully posts in the future won't be this long but 
          I wanted to share my thoughts so far.</p>
